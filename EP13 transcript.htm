<p> <b>Thomas:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[0:00]</small> <span title="0:00 - 0:09">Thomas anthem of the big date of your podcast I'll be your host today for our episode but it will just be me I have another co-host Corey how are you doing today.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Cory:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[0:09]</small> <span title="0:09 - 0:11">Man I'm awesome.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Thomas:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[0:11]</small> <span title="0:11 - 0:19">Then we also have our guest today so I guess is going to be built schmarzo the Dina Big Data built to say hey to the audience.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Bill:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[0:19]</small> <span title="0:19 - 0:26">Hey audience under thanks for having me on the podcast I'm I'm very eager for the kinds of questions you're going to throw at me.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Thomas:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[0:26]</small> <span title="0:26 - 0:39">Will try to be gentle there but first a couple different news items so we've got a couple news topic that we want to jump in and then one after that talk about all the things that you're doing as the dean of big day.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[0:41]</small> <span title="0:41 - 0:48">So the first news topic item that we got for the day is comes in from Katy nuggets it's.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[0:48]</small> <span title="0:48 - 0:58">It's an article about the demand for data scientist is pretty much asking how we hit PCAT and kind of where is the we see the Pete for demand so you don't any bubble that we have,</span><br>
<span title="0:57 - 1:10">you know there's always a time where you know what swells up really fast but then it you kind of deflates and so what they were trying to do is about 1200 different voters and vote on when they think the peak will happen so it's some people there in the industry,</span><br>
<span title="1:10 - 1:17">or maybe I've been in the industry for a little bit longer to its okay,</span><br>
<span title="1:17 - 1:22">ICP anywhere between the next 4 to 10 years just from this pole here.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:23]</small> <span title="1:23 - 1:30">Cory how do you feel about the Pete for data scientist and kind of machine learning and you know how big the market is for you know it's been the sexiest career since.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:30]</small> <span title="1:30 - 1:36">2012 and then seem to be dying what what do you think about the pecan for the interest is for machine learning.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Cory:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:36]</small> <span title="1:36 - 1:49">Well I think it's like anything I don't think humans are very good at looking out past about 4-5 Years anyway so we're kind of the putting that fence out there something that we're going to comfortable if we think we can understand I think the.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[1:50]</small> <span title="1:50 - 2:01">Another thing I like about titties I could say I was cracking up on the duties poles like it's you can tell it's run by a bunch of statisticians cuz they're they're really not only curious about the responses that they get,</span><br>
<span title="2:01 - 2:13">what's really dig into the underlying meaning of the responses and how they're connected and I think that you know that the connection between how long somebody thinks the peak is a way,</span><br>
<span title="2:13 - 2:15">versus how long they've been in data science,</span><br>
<span title="2:15 - 2:23">it's kind of an interesting correlation is I think that those folks that have been in it for a long time for me I did a size perspective.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[2:24]</small> <span title="2:24 - 2:29">I think they're probably a little bit more even I'd the date I think kind of back to sub but they were like.</span><br>
<span title="2:29 - 2:40">I think that they believe it's going to happen faster by the folks that are just into it or still very excited that it's that it's out there that there's a long tail before they start to see the decline but Bill are you still,</span><br>
<span title="2:40 - 2:45">I mean you're clearly still very highly in demand do you think this is findings are accurate.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Bill:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[2:45]</small> <span title="2:45 - 2:47">I know I.</span><br>
<span title="2:47 - 2:59">Don't think we're going to see demand drop off for good data scientist I think I think one of the way I look at this article one of the things that kind of struck me as this there's an underlying belief that the tools are going to bail us out,</span><br>
<span title="2:59 - 3:09">that we're seeing you know I creasing number of tools out there that are designed to make that his term citizen data scientist and I think that's a false prophet.</span><br>
<span title="3:09 - 3:19">I think we're trying to do is create citizens of data science and that the demand for good data scientists will continue to grow because they're the people who know how to monetize a data.</span><br>
<span title="3:19 - 3:29">So while this term data scientist can Encompass anything from people who are doing bi many cases are in Ojai level b i to people who are really doing data science work,</span><br>
<span title="3:29 - 3:38">I think if you really bored this curve down and look at what are the people who are really leveraging data science to monetize my data I think I'm going to see that curve girlfriend is really low today.</span><br>
<span title="3:38 - 3:44">I need the number of people who do that today for effectively is very low and I think that's going to grow over time.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Cory:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[3:44]</small> <span title="3:44 - 3:51">Does not just about the quantity it's about the quality I get it okay so being good is a good thing.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Thomas:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[3:49]</small> <span title="3:49 - 3:52">Yeah
yeah.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Bill:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[3:51]</small> <span title="3:51 - 3:54">Be good to good thing and being better is even better.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Thomas:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[3:54]</small> <span title="3:54 - 4:06">I kind of look at it a different way I don't think we've scratched the surface and I think that even if you're a bad data scientist out there and you're listening I'm glad that you're listening to show we're going to try to give you some tools and help you be a better day to scientist at some point,</span><br>
<span title="4:06 - 4:15">but I also think I think that there's so much to me and we haven't even scratched the surface.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Cory:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[4:16]</small> <span title="4:16 - 4:20">Yeah there's a lot of employers spend a lot of money but I figure out who's going and who's not.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Bill:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[4:20]</small> <span title="4:20 - 4:30">I think I think the tools out there aren't going to take and make more great data scientist I think the great data scientist or doing it today with leather and Stone.</span><br>
<span title="4:30 - 4:40">I think with the tools can do with some of these data science workbenches for example will take an average data scientist and make them good.</span><br>
<span title="4:40 - 4:44">But I got to be honest with you for the bad data scientist there's no help because I think.</span><br>
<span title="4:44 - 4:50">I think there's a real mindset there were some people just don't get it and that's okay.</span><br>
<span title="4:50 - 5:03">But you're not everybody can be the shorts up on the team so we got to play left field and play catcher so it it's it's a specializations task and some people who won't be good data scientist might end up being very good you know data visualization people,</span><br>
<span title="5:03 - 5:06">or data Engineers or data architect so.</span><br>
<span title="5:07 - 5:18">The people who are really good at quantifying cause and effect to a really really good at be able to figure out what variables are actually driving performance those are the ones who are going to continue to be in demand for the End of Time.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Cory:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[5:19]</small> <span title="5:19 - 5:20">That's actually kind of.</span><br>
<span title="5:20 - 5:34">Funny Segway said that said that we we started looking at the there was an article posted informationweek about the the highest paid jobs in Tech and if you if you're going to go down the list all the things that we.</span><br>
<span title="5:34 - 5:40">Thomas starts talking about this it's it's really awesome it's my blowing the number like the the top.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[5:40]</small> <span title="5:40 - 5:45">Paid like top paying job in Tech that is an individual contributor.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[5:45]</small> <span title="5:45 - 5:52">Is a big data engineer which I think they kind of throw some of the data science parts of that job there like in the top.</span><br>
<span title="5:52 - 6:05">Paying jobs in Tech you get a bunch of dudes with season they're tight alright c i o c t o c s o then you get the v's the VP of it but the next guy down number 5 is literally the Big Data engineer salt.</span><br>
<span title="6:05 - 6:13">What I think Bill what you were saying is if you've got good if they're good at finding those cause and effect could make a whole lot of money doing this stuff.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Bill:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[6:15]</small> <span title="6:15 - 6:18">Yeah they took the best day to sign just said at Google.</span><br>
<span title="6:18 - 6:28">Make tons of money because they're the best day to sign it so that end in Google is an expert at monetizing data by the way I thought that I thought that article really.</span><br>
<span title="6:28 - 6:34">I'm in Lost credibility for me immediately when I didn't even have the chief data officer on the list.</span><br>
<span title="6:34 - 6:44">But how do you how do you miss that role of a chick or as we think about organizations who are chartering that role to become more efficient at.</span><br>
<span title="6:44 - 6:52">Monetizing data blogs on the chief data officer role because it's the wrong title.</span><br>
<span title="6:52 - 7:06">It's it's not a cheap date officers not like a mini CIO it should be called the chief data monetization officer the job of the CDO is in monetize data and that's probably the single most important rule of all the rules air in doesn't make the list,</span><br>
<span title="7:07 - 7:21">so this this article sort of I already did already kind of skewed my perspective because you're missing the single most important role in organizations care about which is the the guy or the gal who was charted with monetizing the data,</span><br>
<span title="7:21 - 7:22">so anyway.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Cory:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[7:22]</small> <span title="7:22 - 7:36">Yeah brother are there that many people that actually doing that job right now that's the cuz I get that right I get that at Chief did officers I think is an important pivotal function in an organization to help them along that that curve of monetization.</span><br>
<span title="7:36 - 7:47">What are there that many people doing it that we would in a study like this we're studying you know high paying jobs are there enough of them and are they just not are they not paid as well as some of these other jobs.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Bill:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[7:47]</small> <span title="7:47 - 7:53">Well I think it's I think it's reflects the misnomer when a chief data officer is,</span><br>
<span title="7:53 - 8:01">I think they pulley missed it most organizations have brought in and they taken somebody who is it who is basically you know in the CIO.</span><br>
<span title="8:02 - 8:10">Ladder for the path and they they put more of the CDL roll and said your job is a manager data will no no no there Joshua to monetize a date.</span><br>
<span title="8:10 - 8:16">And if you look at digital media companies they have a roll call Chief Revenue officer,</span><br>
<span title="8:16 - 8:24">whose job is to attend Google's going to Chief Revenue officer in Facebook doesn't Yahoo does in their job is to figure out how do I make money off this data,</span><br>
<span title="8:24 - 8:37">why don't we have people like that shouldn't every organization who has this growing wealth of data who's been asked they're all they're all from in and around how do I monetize my data what you don't have any organization who owns that,</span><br>
<span title="8:37 - 8:39">you want what you want magic to happen,</span><br>
<span title="8:39 - 8:50">so it's to me it's just it's reflective of the fact that people are missing the bigger picture it is not just about grabbing and maintaining data that the end is how do I monetize it.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Thomas:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[8:50]</small> <span title="8:50 - 9:01">Yeah I know I agree I think part of it too and one of the things that stuck out to me in this and so just give credit up there it's an article from informationweek weekly and it's called the 15 highest paid.</span><br>
<span title="9:01 - 9:10">Tech jobs in so I think part of it isn't the tech because I didn't see data scientist on there any either too and I and I think we can get the big data engineer on their number five,</span><br>
<span title="9:09 - 9:17">12 is the data architect and you have a DBA in there 14 but I think part of the problem is they don't see the.</span><br>
<span title="9:16 - 9:23">Monetization officer or chief data officer maybe that's not really registering as a tech job just cuz like we're not seeing them.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[9:23]</small> <span title="9:23 - 9:32">Data scientist on here but we know since 2012 has been one of the sexiest careers out there right and we know that it's in huge demand so I wonder I wonder kind of looking.</span><br>
<span title="9:32 - 9:40">You know if we were ever to look under the covers of some of this technology kind of what jobs did they see that weren't specifically a tech job which and you know it.</span><br>
<span title="9:40 - 9:53">The ones really skewed and whatever you know what what tech jobs are cuz I think everything involves technology that we do you need to make the taste even your Chief marketing officer has to be you have a technical skills and.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Bill:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[9:52]</small> <span title="9:52 - 9:56">Agreed agreed.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Cory:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[9:56]</small> <span title="9:56 - 9:59">Yeah it sucks it's one of those the.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[10:00]</small> <span title="10:00 - 10:13">The truth is the tech is so ingrained in business that it's hard it's hard to decouple the two but I think Thomas I see we're headed like this is like the puretech operator rolls rather than the connected to business which Kindle is a great.</span><br>
<span title="10:13 - 10:22">Conversation for my bills doing so he's so busy is cuz he has so many conversations about Mary in the tube between business and Tech.</span><br>
<span title="10:22 - 10:29">So Bill maybe we maybe we jump into it and let you talk about who you are and what you up to these days.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Bill:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[10:29]</small> <span title="10:29 - 10:31">Sure thanks so.</span><br>
<span title="10:31 - 10:44">Well I'm the that the chief technology officer for Dell EMC big data and i r t Consulting practice which really means it's fancy way of saying I spend all my time on the road talking to and working with customers.</span><br>
<span title="10:44 - 10:57">By far the best job in Industry cuz I get a chance to work with people who are wrestling with these questions all the time I also have the advantage that I I teach part-time at University of San Francisco School of Management.</span><br>
<span title="10:57 - 11:04">Teacher class are called the big day to NBA and the and the purpose of the charter of that classes how do we.</span><br>
<span title="11:04 - 11:10">Teach tomorrow's Business Leaders to embrace analytics as a business discipline that is.</span><br>
<span title="11:11 - 11:24">The analytics is no longer the realm of what I T does that for they successful organizations of they're going to Business Leaders need to embrace and likes to the business discipline to become citizens of data science.</span><br>
<span title="11:24 - 11:32">Almond understand how data science helps him make more money history wise I've been in the data analytics space for.</span><br>
<span title="11:32 - 11:41">God knows how long I got started back in the 1980s doing data warehousing by I had one of those so you know Forrest Gump moments in your life,</span><br>
<span title="11:41 - 11:53">we're in the right place right time. Because I'm tall or good looking or from Iowa you every time sometimes in life you just get lucky right place right time and in 8788 I was lucky I was wearing the project at Procter &amp; Gamble will be brought in,</span><br>
<span title="11:53 - 12:01">Walmart's Point of Sales data for the first time in to do analysis on it which really sort of launched the whole day to warehouse and bi space.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[12:02]</small> <span title="12:02 - 12:06">So I spent 27 years in a bi did warehouse space know it very well.</span><br>
<span title="12:06 - 12:15">I'm a star schema guy work close to Ralph Kimball for many years and then about 14 years ago I was recruited out of business objects where I was the vice president of analytic applications.</span><br>
<span title="12:16 - 12:25">I was recruited by Yahoo to build out their Advertiser analytics which was designed to how do we help advertisers optimize or spend across the Yahoo ad Network.</span><br>
<span title="12:25 - 12:33">And that was a that was a water
stone moment for me are you know ah ah a milestone moment in the sense that.</span><br>
<span title="12:34 - 12:42">Everything that I had learned about bi and data warehousing was now wrong and everything and how I approach Beyond data warehouse and I had to unlearn,</span><br>
<span title="12:43 - 12:49">do I move into a world where I wasn't dealing with gigabytes of data I was dealing with petabytes of data and I wasn't dealing with you know,</span><br>
<span title="12:49 - 12:59">100 dimensions of dealing with a million dimensions and and so you know 500 million customers a day coming to Yahoo and understanding what add to show them what time,</span><br>
<span title="12:59 - 13:09">everything I knew about their porch light done before the whole idea of slice and dice just didn't scale so if the last several almost last decade a half and I've been spending time,</span><br>
<span title="13:09 - 13:23">working in this world of big data and data science now it's all machine learning artificial intelligence and deep learning neural networks in to pick your favorite technology but it's really all has always boil down to one one conversation.</span><br>
<span title="13:24 - 13:33">Which is how do I make money out of my data how do I use my data to make me more money so.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[13:33]</small> <span title="13:33 - 13:41">That's kind of the role that I do and I'm like I said I'm very fortunate because I spend all my time with customers who are at various stages in their big data business model maturity,</span><br>
<span title="13:41 - 13:48">I'm going to give me a chance and I understand where they are and their challenges would also give me a chance to work with them to help Advance them along that maturity index.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Thomas:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[13:49]</small> <span title="13:49 - 14:00">That's awesome bill and I know we've had some different conversations before in the past about you know some of your time at Yahoo but just just for the listeners out there I mean it's so cool I mean you are you are at Yahoo.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[14:00]</small> <span title="14:00 - 14:06">Don't people how to make more money right out of the data that you had at the same time that Hadoop was me and you know,</span><br>
<span title="14:06 - 14:16">mainstream to incubated in open sores can you give us a little background on what that was like to be a part of Amina versus so many smart people Yahoo at that time and all the things that came out of there I mean it's just.</span><br>
<span title="14:16 - 14:17">Just so amazing.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Bill:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[14:18]</small> <span title="14:18 - 14:23">Yeah there was a group of yahuah call STS and think it was for strategic Data Solutions.</span><br>
<span title="14:24 - 14:30">And when that group kind of got disbanded there's about 40 people in that group and they were amazing,</span><br>
<span title="14:30 - 14:34">twister it was the best brightest bunch of people I've ever worked with,</span><br>
<span title="14:34 - 14:48">in that group disbanded you can see across in a Cloudera and map are and hortonworks and all these other big data analytics companies you can see no Green Plumbing sucks you can see all these different people should have went out and they,</span><br>
<span title="14:48 - 14:53">and they seated this whole big data conversion is whole big data craze,</span><br>
<span title="14:53 - 15:02">preceded by what was going on at Yahoo and how when they decide that group how all these really smart people landed and spots and started a growing on tree started growing everywhere.</span><br>
<span title="15:02 - 15:12">As a as a user I am not a technology guy but the things that I could do with Hadoop and the analytics we had around that.</span><br>
<span title="15:12 - 15:17">To me were staggering and I could build detail profiles on every visitor.</span><br>
<span title="15:17 - 15:25">I could know you know work sites they've been to what they were most interested in what they clicked on what keywords they searched I knew so much about them.</span><br>
<span title="15:25 - 15:29">And if and when you know so much about every individual customer.</span><br>
<span title="15:29 - 15:38">Then your ability to make really strong recommendations like what add you think that person is most likely to want to see cuz if I can make that if I can improve that by .1%.</span><br>
<span title="15:38 - 15:50">It's worth tens of millions of dollars of the organization so the the lot of the concepts that I had brought to Yahoo about how bi and data warehousing work were wrong.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[15:50]</small> <span title="15:50 - 15:57">In this new world but the ideas about how you monetize we're still spot on so while I lost a lot of the,</span><br>
<span title="15:57 - 16:07">my technology footing for many years before I finally understood the whole the concept behind data science and Big Data the monetization concepts became even more,</span><br>
<span title="16:07 - 16:12">convincing I was even more convinced of the ability to monetize that data and unique ways.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Thomas:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[16:12]</small> <span title="16:12 - 16:18">So in your soil Bill and your roll out there and you you're talking about your kind of.</span><br>
<span title="16:18 - 16:24">Broke the way that you saw the world as bi and data warehouse and so you've been involved.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[16:24]</small> <span title="16:24 - 16:34">You know when this part for at least 10 years when you're out there talking to customers do you do find yourself having to evangelize to some extent I know you know about the monetization but saying hey the way that we look at you know.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[16:35]</small> <span title="16:35 - 16:50">Business intelligence Armada warehouses think about it differently now you can have vast amounts of data and process if you find yourself you know kind of having to break that mold and kind of new show people hate you know I was I was in your feet but the way that you're so vastly different kind of Angeles,</span><br>
<span title="16:50 - 16:51">for that some extent.</span><br>

<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[16:51]</small> <span title="16:51 - 16:55">Clearly in fact what I would I like to do is I like to,</span><br>
<span title="16:55 - 17:09">with a customer sort of talked about you want to talk about their environment first and more times not to talk about your behind data warehouse environments and their analytics environment you're really no Trend reports and then very loose term Analytics,</span><br>
<span title="17:09 - 17:13">little paws and I say do you want a report or do you want to predict.</span><br>
<span title="17:14 - 17:19">Do you want a report on what customers left or do you want to predict them which ones are likely to leave.</span><br>
<span title="17:19 - 17:25">Do you want a report on what products are like in the breakdown or do you want to predict which ones are so you can prevent them,</span><br>
<span title="17:25 - 17:35">and you start the mindset this whole concept of how do I get people how do we get people to think like a data scientist to stop thinking about reporting on what happened.</span><br>
<span title="17:35 - 17:40">Predicting what's likely to happen so I can prescribe action so I can prevent.</span><br>
<span title="17:40 - 17:48">Best there's it's a mindset changed it if you can get people to make that mind shift that change in mind shift.</span><br>
<span title="17:49 - 17:59">The Technologies are all out there to help them move along their technology to help you better predictors Technologies to help you better prescribed and there's technology help you better prevent.</span><br>
<span title="17:59 - 18:08">But if you don't have that mindshift first if you're still thinking that data and analytics about reporting on what happened and you're going to run your company using a rear view mirror.</span><br>
<span title="18:09 - 18:12">No no you get in so that's by far.</span><br>
<span title="18:12 - 18:23">I take is by far the biggest challenges hydrated organization to make that my shift because once they do it and I've seen this happen with the light bulbs go off and then go oh my gosh I get it.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[18:23]</small> <span title="18:23 - 18:28">I'm not I'm not I'm not trying to report on,</span><br>
<span title="18:28 - 18:37">the time of my 6-year graduation rate I'm trying to predict what my 6-year graduation will be next year and understand the data and the variables that might impact at so I can actually,</span><br>
<span title="18:37 - 18:45">prevent students from dropping out prevent students from staying longer it's just that once you can make that mind shift everything else Falls in place.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Cory:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[18:45]</small> <span title="18:45 - 18:52">So it's a mindset shift obviously amongst the people in the organization.</span><br>
<span title="18:52 - 18:55">But there's there's something I feel like might be sort of.</span><br>
<span title="18:55 - 19:08">Missing and I think I think that's where it where you spent probably a lot of time as high as a business practitioner of you know whether I'm up you know a college counselor and you talk about graduation rates are high school whatever I'm trying to figure out how to improve that.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[19:08]</small> <span title="19:08 - 19:14">Shifting from hey I can tell somebody in it that I want to report.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[19:14]</small> <span title="19:14 - 19:22">Just so I can look at it is it is a much simpler Argus more Jermaine thing that I T and R and R.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[19:22]</small> <span title="19:22 - 19:35">Are even our data being are dbas if I have been they've been skilled to to achieve right but to shift and start to say hey I need to understand how to predict these things.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[19:36]</small> <span title="19:36 - 19:46">That's that's organizationally a very big challenge to go from Pam and I have business Acumen that I think right hypotheses about like I think this is might be influencers,</span><br>
<span title="19:46 - 19:57">how do you like it's besides just the mindset that somebody says have want to predict versus go over the review mirror what are the what are the big things that organizationally they have to do to,</span><br>
<span title="19:57 - 20:01">actually an able when they had the light bulbs go off.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[20:01]</small> <span title="20:01 - 20:10">How do you get them organization to be able to respond to those new kinds of requests as new kinds of your ways of running a business.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Bill:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[20:10]</small> <span title="20:10 - 20:19">Remind me to explain to you is so simple that it's really hard to understand why every doesn't do it cuz it companies who do this.</span><br>
<span title="20:19 - 20:30">What's a made that this this shift execution is simple and what we focus in on his what are your company's key business initiative the next 12 to 18 months.</span><br>
<span title="20:30 - 20:39">Are you focused on increasing stamps for sale his focus on improving quality of care in a hospital you report trying to improve on-time delivery if your logistics company.</span><br>
<span title="20:39 - 20:48">What are you trying to achieve in the business I might that's a starting point in the reason why that's an important turning point because because there's money attached to that if I can reduce.</span><br>
<span title="20:49 - 20:55">L does late deliveries by 10% to some company that may be worth 100 to 200 million dollars a year.</span><br>
<span title="20:55 - 21:04">But that's a lot of money that's a lot of money so it has to start with the business conversation of what's important to business cuz if you don't have that.</span><br>
<span title="21:05 - 21:14">It's nearly impossible to figure out how to monetize your data analytics if you don't know what problem trying to solve
we take it one step further let's see your problem is.</span><br>
<span title="21:15 - 21:24">Customer customer retention you got a backup retention problem and you're trying to find a way to improve attention by 5% and it's worth something dollar amount the organization.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[21:25]</small> <span title="21:25 - 21:34">What we then do is we work with the business stakeholders to identify the decisions they need to make in order to support customer retention.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[21:35]</small> <span title="21:35 - 21:43">It's so for example they will say we got to make decisions regarding which customers are at risk and oh by the way now that you saw the flag what customers are at risk.</span><br>
<span title="21:43 - 21:51">What's the predicted value of each of those customers if I have a customer who is at risk who's predicted value to the organization is negative I might want to let them go.</span><br>
<span title="21:51 - 22:06">I need to make a decision about what what kind of offers do I give them in what channels do I reach them through and what time of day and how do I retarget at right so all the sudden if you focus on the decisions if you focus on the decisions.</span><br>
<span title="22:07 - 22:16">The data science team knows how to optimize decisions you want to flag at risk customers the data science he will help you do it.</span><br>
<span title="22:16 - 22:28">They will help you figure out and buy the business takeovers have to be involved in that process throughout cuz it's a very key aspect of that process and it's built on this very simple definition of what is data science.</span><br>
<span title="22:28 - 22:34">Here's my definition data science I share with my students and the exactly so I get into these workshops.</span><br>
<span title="22:35 - 22:44">Data science is about identifying those variables in metrics that might be better predictors of performance.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[22:45]</small> <span title="22:45 - 22:47">. that's it.</span><br>
<span title="22:47 - 22:59">What are using machine learning supervisor on supervised or neural networks or whatever that's all I'm trying to do is to find variables and metrics that might be better predictions performance if I know.</span><br>
<span title="22:59 - 23:08">What decisions are trying to support and I've got a data scientist in collaboration with the business team to brainstorm what day that they might need I've got a winning combination.</span><br>
<span title="23:08 - 23:14">Let me let me kind of rooster going to log on this topic let me take you to an exercise to take my students,</span><br>
<span title="23:14 - 23:24">destroyed that the power of thinking like a data scientist so I take my my MBA students I say okay you've been hired by United Airlines sorry it was only job available it was either that or be homeless.</span><br>
<span title="23:24 - 23:33">So and your first job your first job is to forecast how many passengers are going to fly from San Francisco to Paris next month.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[23:34]</small> <span title="23:34 - 23:39">And then I say what date of mind you need might be in the key phrase not playing might in a second here,</span><br>
<span title="23:39 - 23:52">what day did Mike Zunino to make that forecast this I break them into groups of three or four and they they break off and they kicked there Post-it notes in there and their chart there and their brainstorming data on there in about 10 minutes or so I bring them all back,</span><br>
<span title="23:51 - 23:59">share with me what data you might need to know to make that forecast and always start talking the same way well how many people flew last month,</span><br>
<span title="23:59 - 24:12">for the last 12 months into the same month a year ago same month two years ago and I flew by day by time of day but in all the kind of transactional foundational stuff by the way most that transaction the foundations of his phone here.</span><br>
<span title="24:12 - 24:21">Sorry that you already have it been doing reports on it for 4 years if not decades then there's this kind of this pause and you can literally start seeing the light bulbs go off.</span><br>
<span title="24:22 - 24:31">And some of those say well what's the exchange rate hasn't changed in the last 12 months and somebody will say well you know how many weekends in a month how many days in a month early holidays in the month.</span><br>
<span title="24:31 - 24:36">Are there any special events going on in Paris it somebody else will say are there any strikes,</span><br>
<span title="24:36 - 24:48">plan in Paris in and what was the last terrorist attack and how many Google searches were there on price of the tickets at how many Pinterest pins were there on hotels of all these different data sources,</span><br>
<span title="24:48 - 24:58">that might be useful might be in the key phrase you want to capture as many ideas as possible cuz we don't know for certain which variables might be the most predictive.</span><br>
<span title="24:58 - 25:06">The people who will then tell you which data sources are the most valuable are the most predictive are the ones that you're going to give you the most insides of a data scientist.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[25:07]</small> <span title="25:07 - 25:19">And I'll go through the do all their magic to figure out which of 50 different neural network Technologies me using to mine too deep learn this technology mildew machine right and they will come back and say all these are the five or six most predictive variables.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[25:20]</small> <span title="25:20 - 25:33">That's what they do so when you combine the business stakeholders let them brainstorm what day that they might need with a date of society will tell you which data source attraction was predictive you have a winning combination.</span><br>
<span title="25:33 - 25:46">And you have results not on you have better results but you have the most difficult thing to achieve in the big day today to science conversation is you now have business stakeholder buy-in.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Thomas:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[25:47]</small> <span title="25:47 - 25:53">No that's that's that's amazing but that's great stuff there it sounds like it what you're saying is.</span><br>
<span title="25:53 - 26:08">It's a team sport right data science and you know coming together to find out okay what the business problem is and then one of these factors I mean it's not it's not just a hey we need to salt and you give it to your data scientist and they go off in a room don't talk to anybody and close the door I mean is that,</span><br>
<span title="26:08 - 26:09">show me nuts.</span><br>
<span title="26:09 - 26:18">That's kind of what we've said about Developers for a long time you know where we started getting into this more Agile development and you'll get everybody in a room and talking together and really trying to figure these things out together.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Bill:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[26:18]</small> <span title="26:18 - 26:24">Yeah it's it's it is certainly a team sport the client we see that have the most success.</span><br>
<span title="26:24 - 26:30">And by the way the date that the marginal Improvement is dramatic,</span><br>
<span title="26:30 - 26:36">3 to 5% were talking 3 to 5x are the organizations were the business and the data scientist collaborate close,</span><br>
<span title="26:36 - 26:44">and the under and by the way that's the real key is it can we get the business stakeholders to really understand that analytics is a business discipline,</span><br>
<span title="26:44 - 26:49">episode discipline as accounting and Finance in economics are.</span><br>
<span title="26:49 - 27:06">We're not going to make you learn you know it's how to program an inmail parole or job RR python no we're not going to make you do that but we want to be part of this process because we need to understand the decisions you're making a bag of those decisions we need to understand what data source are most valuable if you don't understand in the date,</span><br>
<span title="27:06 - 27:10">these are the models were coming up with effective enough for you to act on.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Thomas:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[27:10]</small> <span title="27:10 - 27:12">Also.</span><br>
<span title="27:12 - 27:24">I follow I follow a lot of kind of what you're saying and I chill more to the data engineer side so you know I'm on the technologist kind of working with the check and that's where I start off in my career but one of the things that I've always.</span><br>
<span title="27:24 - 27:34">Don't really really great about what you're saying is like you even for an engineer you need to understand what the business value is it so we can all see a lot of the content I followed you know the blocks that you put in.</span><br>
<span title="27:33 - 27:47">You really publishing a lot but I mean it's just it's really helpful for the data engineer to say how you even need to know how to explain the problems right so you want you want to use all these cool Technologies you want to be apart you know what's going on with her be with it,</span><br>
<span title="27:47 - 27:55">Community but to be able to get your project sold and get your project sign off on you have to explain why this business value to it so.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Bill:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[27:55]</small> <span title="27:55 - 28:04">Yeah you said it really wants is a team sport right I got to have a data engineer and a data architect and knows how to go get the data and put it into an architecture allows me to go,</span><br>
<span title="28:04 - 28:16">Hazel E access it if my data science thing I did decide to do that then they're not doing it with it but they need to do and what is a data science they decide to do the single most important thing they do is they quantify cause and effect,</span><br>
<span title="28:16 - 28:24">are they build the analytic models that basically tell you which variables are most predictive they quantify cause-and-effect they measure goodness of fit the only do two things right,</span><br>
<span title="28:24 - 28:34">to really hard thing to do but they do it I want I want my data engineers and Architects helping to build the right platform getting the right data for more data visualization people they're using,</span><br>
<span title="28:34 - 28:48">pop tools like Tableau and you're my favorite ggplot2 and trying to figure out what date is moving together I want a human-centered design person involved in the team who is going to help me understand how the analytic results are going to be rendered to my users to make an actionable,</span><br>
<span title="28:48 - 28:50">it's a team sport.</span><br>
<span title="28:50 - 29:06">And so when I start thinking about that it's just like a baseball team right I can't have my short stop playing first base pitching and catching it isn't going to work right different skill sets different people so it's no different for the data science team it's a team sport of which the business people,</span><br>
<span title="29:05 - 29:12">have to be on the team as well as any other business constituents God have them on the team.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Thomas:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[29:12]</small> <span title="29:12 - 29:23">Yeah I know and like I was saying you know a lot of the stuff that you put you know you're with your blogs and everything you know I try to encourage people whenever I'm talking to you what can I do know a lot of people ask you know how.</span><br>
<span title="29:23 - 29:34">Other developers are dating Engineers they're saying okay what should I do what kind of my role and I kind of basically put it down to three different roles if we think about you everyday,</span><br>
<span title="29:34 - 29:43">scientist in each one has their own lane or some weed over but I still think there's value and I think you're for the date engineer you do need to know and understand.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[29:44]</small> <span title="29:44 - 29:46">The Y of the project.</span><br>
<span title="29:46 - 29:55">Did you continue to have some somewhat of an understanding about what that data scientist is going to do and then also the data visualization person too but I mean you know a lot of the content that you're.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[29:55]</small> <span title="29:55 - 30:01">That you're doing with your blog and stuff I mean.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Bill:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[30:01]</small> <span title="30:01 - 30:10">Haha well I understand that God gave me two ears and one mouth I listen to our customers.</span><br>
<span title="30:10 - 30:17">Today they tell me my steps only only interesting because of my customers are interested.</span><br>
<span title="30:17 - 30:28">I will be honest with you anymore almost all of the topics that I can come up with come from customer conversations questions they ask problems I've got it sits if you if you stay close to the customers.</span><br>
<span title="30:29 - 30:34">And you're really trying to help them and by the way sincerely in my heart I want my customer be successful.</span><br>
<span title="30:34 - 30:42">I want to have success with it be successful and you know I am by the way I want to be late to that success let them know that hey Bill schmarzo help me be successful.</span><br>
<span title="30:43 - 30:51">I want if you listen to your customers they will tell you what they need to also tell you what they want and I'm less interested in what they want.</span><br>
<span title="30:51 - 30:58">I want to focus on what you need so you'll get a lot of cuz I think this is what happened in the early days of big data right you went out and you went out and bought her do.</span><br>
<span title="30:58 - 31:11">And you threw some data on it and you hired some data scientist righty put on some stories and some servers because that's what the customer wanted to do and the technology committee was more than happy to blindly follow along and do that.</span><br>
<span title="31:11 - 31:18">That's not that's what they wanted but not what they needed what they needed was somebody to come in and help them figure out how my going to monetize estate.</span><br>
<span title="31:18 - 31:31">Holiday I take this data to you to make better decisions how am I going to improve retention and attribution and acquisition how am I going to improve the business we we we didn't listen.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[31:31]</small> <span title="31:31 - 31:37">Well because we we we listen to what they wanted and we blindly fell alongside them instead of taking the time to be a,</span><br>
<span title="31:37 - 31:41">business partner and say no you said that you just may be what you want.</span><br>
<span title="31:41 - 31:55">Right here is what you need is this and we focus on what they need and what they're trying to accomplish the whole thing the whole conversation changes my my relations with most of my clients are wonderful because we talk about their business.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Cory:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[31:54]</small> <span title="31:54 - 32:06">They also makes me laugh because of what you just said there's made me think of one of my favorite Henry Ford quotes which is if it asked my customers what they wanted they would have told me a faster horse.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[32:07]</small> <span title="32:07 - 32:14">Bright-eyed science and it's it's kind of it right so you had these customers that you know because everybody the norm was.</span><br>
<span title="32:14 - 32:20">Hey Technologies going to solve the problem just invest in the latest new technology you know that's what the weird,</span><br>
<span title="32:20 - 32:32">we were asking for him that's what the technology Community gave them was basically Faster Horses right you could with Hadoop you could handle larger data sets and you could ever Handle With Us sequel database right but I like where you're going.</span><br>
<span title="32:32 - 32:37">It wasn't necessarily what they needed which was how do you connect.</span><br>

<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[32:37]</small> <span title="32:37 - 32:53">Using the technology to dry the business outcomes I got to ask you work in a Consulting organization right that goes out and then I'm guessing right part of what Consulting does you have smart people can come in and deliver on the things that you're evangelizing,</span><br>
<span title="32:53 - 33:01">what are the what are the specific sort of like offerings and Consulting like how do they how does.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[33:02]</small> <span title="33:02 - 33:13">How does a customer engage with you like what is an engagement look like in terms of specific like always with you and what's the process for.</span><br>

<span title="33:21 - 33:31">Customers come to us in with one of two problems then this isn't this is generally speaking there is little more to this the customers have one or two problems.</span><br>
<span title="33:31 - 33:38">Either they're trying to do data monetization and they have no idea what the hell they're doing or their data Lakes are not performing.</span><br>
<span title="33:39 - 33:43">Invited over to someone related fact they're very relatable they're coming from two different perspectives.</span><br>
<span title="33:43 - 33:57">And so it was the second I hit first as we have a lot of organizations that have built data Lakes Mobile Data lakes and they're not get any value out of it and the first thing I say is that I hear the word I hear the word data Lakes I see you got a problem.</span><br>
<span title="33:57 - 34:10">Cuz you're replicating the same problem we had with data warehouses we didn't have one day to Warehouse we have multiple data warehouses in data Marts and spread Martin we created this this environment with the business we taught the business users to trust a data,</span><br>
<span title="34:10 - 34:19">the biggest the biggest flaw in data warehousing is it we taught users not to trust the data because the data was dependent upon which it came from.</span><br>
<span title="34:20 - 34:25">Huge mistake right we set we sent data warehousing back a decade because we couldn't standardize and by the way,</span><br>
<span title="34:25 - 34:33">we couldn't respond quick enough in a data warehouse the customers business data needs we just quit here to build a schema first,</span><br>
<span title="34:33 - 34:44">Hina architected for trying to make a stupid thing one on on databases that were designed for transactional systems like analytical systems but that's a topic for another series of beers and podcast but so,</span><br>
<span title="34:44 - 34:54">problem number one is customers have a data Lake and they don't know what to do with it. It doesn't scale it doesn't meet their business needs and so we have a whole series of offerings are really guides.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[34:54]</small> <span title="34:54 - 35:01">Advisory service and assessment a proof of technology did really design a take and their data Lake from a.</span><br>
<span title="35:01 - 35:09">Stack of technology to an elastic data platform to a Clarity value creation platform I call that last one day too late 3.0.</span><br>
<span title="35:09 - 35:13">We are data Lake now is a collaborative value creation plate platform,</span><br>
<span title="35:13 - 35:25">that's a repository for your data and analytics digital assets but I can reuse across multiple use cases that I can monetize across multiple use cases so entry point number one is the data light.</span><br>
<span title="35:25 - 35:28">They got a data Lake it's not working how do we help.</span><br>
<span title="35:29 - 35:36">We got some you got some verses to help them do that we can take them from where they are to where they need to be in order to be able to drive no monetization opportunities.</span><br>

<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[35:37]</small> <span title="35:37 - 35:47">The other conversation is really around monetization how do I monetize my data and this is an interesting one guys because we're typically starts off with his I'm trying to sell my data.</span><br>
<span title="35:48 - 35:49">Wrong approach.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[35:50]</small> <span title="35:50 - 36:00">And I'm going to go old-school back on you and when I go back to Adam Smith in his book Wealth of Nations written in 1776 they have a Smith and that book talks about value Creation in two ways.</span><br>
<span title="36:00 - 36:08">One way he talks about his called value in exchange that is what is an asset worth in my ability to sell it or barter or somebody else.</span><br>
<span title="36:08 - 36:13">And when people start thinking data monetization the first thing they're thinking about it what can I sell my data for.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[36:15]</small> <span title="36:15 - 36:29">Companies are in the date of business most companies are you just got to come he's not a database that you want to scare the pants off just say one word you say Equifax right and they turn all pale white know you don't want to be in the business of monetizing of value through through Exchange.</span><br>
<span title="36:29 - 36:37">Adam Smith also talked about creating value through use how do you use your data to drive better business outcomes.</span><br>
<span title="36:38 - 36:44">That's what we focus in on in order to do that to have that data monetization conversation around value in use.</span><br>
<span title="36:44 - 36:53">It has to start with key business initiatives it has to start with use cases it has to start with what decisions are you trying to make what business outcomes you trying to optimize.</span><br>
<span title="36:53 - 36:58">So I can fold them from his ability to take to take either one of those tracks.</span><br>
<span title="36:58 - 37:11">But you all are designed to get us to a point where we can take and monetize our data on a platform of data like platform it's elastic scale-out and allows it to create this value this cloudy value creation platform.</span><br>
<span title="37:11 - 37:24">By the way that turned out cloudy value creation platform isn't my term that came from the series a conversation with the IMF against smart customers asking SmartThings demanding SmartThings we all get a chance to learn from them.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Cory:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[37:24]</small> <span title="37:24 - 37:33">That's awesome yeah actually it's interesting you said that that one of the things that organizations find out is that their data may actually be.</span><br>
<span title="37:32 - 37:47">Less valuable than they think in terms of when they think in terms of exchange I was blown away I spent the last three weeks and in Asia and and and the southeast and Southeast Asian in Australia where was a ton of customers.</span><br>
<span title="37:46 - 37:56">That had that exact thing in mind which is the the value exchange conversation do you actually see other companies that are making money.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[37:56]</small> <span title="37:56 - 38:03">And that sort of their value of the data is in the exchange of where they're selling it cuz I get asked that.</span><br>
<span title="38:02 - 38:07">Constantly by cool if I collected the state of how who can I sell it to.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Bill:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[38:08]</small> <span title="38:08 - 38:21">Selling data is a very specialized business and companies like you know AC Nielsen and and Axiom and Equifax and such they they they are geared to do that.</span><br>
<span title="38:21 - 38:26">They have processes for bringing date in cleansing at a line in it.</span><br>
<span title="38:26 - 38:39">Packaging acting at Salesforce in and out of cell data they got markings on a market data they know how to do Version Control and upgrades and got in most cases they have Security in in in a liability coverage and things like that regulatory coverage and such,</span><br>
<span title="38:39 - 38:42">that's not something your average company give it a pickup.</span><br>
<span title="38:43 - 38:57">Killer special ice companies in when a company talk about one of my toys my data is like will give a Salesforce you know how you're going to price it how you going to what kind of upgrade you going to have right what were some Main and stream look like and they have no idea because they're not in that business so so.</span><br>
<span title="38:57 - 39:06">End of the day your data is actually worth a lot more to you than it is to them because I thought time you remove all the pii and HIPAA information on your data,</span><br>
<span title="39:06 - 39:16">it's interesting but it's more interesting you before I know what behaviors Bill schmarzo is doing let's just sit in Amazon's world for a second.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[39:16]</small> <span title="39:16 - 39:26">Amazon has done a masterful job of learning everything they can about every individual customer I just masterful and.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[39:27]</small> <span title="39:27 - 39:36">They they lie bridge that to be able to predict what products you might want so I can show you when you're on my side what products you might also want to buy.</span><br>
<span title="39:36 - 39:47">Great right thing they've done that collaborative filtering if there was a match for that for a long time but they've gone one step further like the one of the things that they do and now they have these Depots in certain zip codes.</span><br>
<span title="39:47 - 39:56">And they can put products in those Depots with a high degree of confidence is somebody in that zip codes going to buy that product how do they do that.</span><br>
<span title="39:56 - 40:11">The forecast at every individual customer level what products you might want in an aggregate that up and when the air condition gets to a certain level they can safely say that zip code there's enough people there they're going to want to have HP printer ink.</span><br>
<span title="40:11 - 40:20">I'm going to put printer HP printer ink into that Depot so when you order it it's going to show up you know 2 or 4 hours later or where drones are going to show up 30 minutes later right so,</span><br>
<span title="40:20 - 40:34">that that very detail profiles is something organizations can do themselves that they can't give to somebody else without violating pie and HIPAA and other sort of rules so the real value in their data isn't the overall market trends.</span><br>
<span title="40:35 - 40:39">It's the bat individual level I got like to see the big date is not about big.</span><br>
<span title="40:39 - 40:54">Big data is about small it's about as learning as much as possible about each individual customer their behaviors are Tennessee's repent cities are in collisions are interest or passions relations or associations learn as much as possible about them so I can better serve them.</span><br>

<span title="41:02 - 41:12">the weather be printer ink or wherever you need it in that Regional location because there might be a run on it it's what we talked about a long time ago you know when your business classes with Just in Time Manufacturing right but,</span><br>
<span title="41:12 - 41:19">to the suppliers and so you're one of the big things in the last 2 or 3 years is not hey man I want a drone to be able to deliver things right you know.</span><br>
<span title="41:20 - 41:32">How's the regulations going to happen you know that they going to allow for drones to deliver your my Amazon packages all the way from Seattle to where I live in Alabama.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[41:49]</small> <span title="41:49 - 41:57">New York City for example you know they would almost kind of like how you have food trucks that have Amazon trucks right know what to put on there if nobody needs.</span><br>
<span title="41:57 - 42:09">The printer ink are nobody needs new headphones why would you put that on the you're wasting that product space and it's more than the competitiveness that you see you know when they talk about shelf space in.</span><br>

<span title="43:13 - 43:26">Tutu evangelized is the value of data in organizations in unfortunately Dave and I talk to my students after they've gone to the real world now they run into the Quagmire of the,</span><br>
<span title="43:26 - 43:34">bureaucracy of large organizations right in and to serviced and this may sound overly harsh but I've I've given up on my generation.</span><br>
<span title="43:35 - 43:42">I think that the My Generation has and my generation is the is the bi data warehouse generation.</span><br>
<span title="43:43 - 43:47">Where we were more than happy to report on what happened and thought we had achieved success.</span><br>
<span title="43:48 - 43:57">The next generation is demanding more and the Millennials and part of that is a Millennials have experienced what and what is it about,</span><br>
<span title="43:57 - 44:02">think about how their lives are driven by recommendations whether it's,</span><br>
<span title="44:02 - 44:14">Amazon or Netflix or Spotify or eHarmony or ways whatever they like their entire their entire life is now built around very detailed analytics helps them live their life better.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[44:15]</small> <span title="44:15 - 44:23">That those experiences have changed their expectations of what they want out of a corporation and I think as those people,</span><br>
<span title="44:23 - 44:29">has his Millennial start to progress up in the organization they're going to bring that to the business many cios I talk to,</span><br>
<span title="44:29 - 44:40">you're hopeless they are just marking time until I can retire now they've they rode the wave of data Rawson bi gotten and now they're more concerned about blocking,</span><br>
<span title="44:40 - 44:48">data lakes and data science and they are about promoting it sorry to be so harsh but we there's too many cios who have outlived their usefulness,</span><br>
<span title="44:48 - 44:56">in my hope is at the Millennials I pry won't be here to see an experience that but the Millennials are going to because they have a different experience a different mindset,</span><br>
<span title="44:56 - 45:03">are going to be able to really understand about the power of analytics to really help their customers be more successful.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Cory:</b> <br>

<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[45:46]</small> <span title="45:46 - 45:57">How did you how did you end up teaching that's that's an interesting I think for a lot of us at our in and technology and said if if you have a proclivity towards you know dealing with customers and speaking and.</span><br>
<span title="45:57 - 46:02">Concentration lot of things that you're doing I think that a lot of a lot of us are kind of into.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[46:03]</small> <span title="46:03 - 46:15">It feels like a it feels like a one while simultaneously a natural progression also a very weird and like almost backward one I don't know how did you how did you end up doing that.</span><br>

</p><p> <b>Bill:</b> <br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[46:16]</small> <span title="46:16 - 46:19">Well I was I was trying to do guest lectures,</span><br>
<span title="46:19 - 46:28">I'm a lot of different universities across the u.s. might my books have been adopted by many universities as part of their,</span><br>
<span title="46:28 - 46:33">both MBA programs and some of the action part of engineering program so I had sort of a natural,</span><br>
<span title="46:33 - 46:45">way to speak to people for the first book in particular kind of open the door and then I did a guest lecture at USF had a chance to meet the the fellow who is ahead of the business and,</span><br>
<span title="46:45 - 46:53">I analytics College there we hit it off well he wanted me to do a class we did a class it was very successful,</span><br>
<span title="46:53 - 46:56">Tom and desconto coffin there.</span><br>
<span title="46:56 - 47:05">It's it's been a marvelous relationship because it allows me to no no it's forces me to simplify.</span><br>
<span title="47:05 - 47:12">The students when I asked the students in the class how many people here no data warehouse is no one raises their hands.</span><br>
<span title="47:13 - 47:22">No one cares no one cares and we start asking questions about you know what is your most.</span><br>
<span title="47:22 - 47:26">Impressive experience on the internet they love how how,</span><br>
<span title="47:26 - 47:32">Amazon can tell me what I need to do or what Netflix will pick movies for me or no they they talk about there,</span><br>
<span title="47:32 - 47:43">experiences from organizations that have mastered leveraging data and analytics really improve the customer experience they understand that so they it's it's force me to think very hard about what's really important.</span><br>
<span title="47:44 - 47:50">And how do I take Concepts and simplify them to the point of an executable.</span><br>

</p>
<p> <small style="opacity: 0.5;">[47:50]</small> <span title="47:50 - 48:00">Like my definition of data science right did Ida simplify that cuz of students that say what is data science and I don't want to spend 3 hours explain what data Sciences I want to explain it in 15 words or less.</span><br>
<span title="48:00 - 48:08">What's supervised vs. unsupervised machine learning right I can explain that forward so you know what that's that's what I,</span><br>
<span title="48:08 - 48:16">it forces me to simplify and when you do that I think all the BS it gets in our way as technicians fall to the Wayside,</span><br>
<span title="48:16 - 48:19">and now we're focused on the heart of what's important.</span><br>

<span title="49:09 - 49:16">what what would what would your core message be to tell them why it's so important in their roles to be connected to these business outcomes.</span><br>

<span title="49:31 - 49:45">People and organizations figure out how do I take advantage of data scientist data science as a as a monetization platform and I start with that and I think what you'll see very quickly is that when you focus in on the business outcomes.</span><br>
<span title="49:45 - 49:52">All the technology decisions you need to make architecture decisions you need to make data scientist need to make sure they all become self evident.</span><br>
<span title="49:53 - 49:59">I like to say no somebody walked me to the Haitian Mars do I need to have spark my interest going to be I don't know.</span><br>

<span title="50:15 - 50:26">so it's it the understand the business outcome for trying to drive now it doesn't make our technology did data and data science jobs easier.</span><br>
<span title="50:26 - 50:40">It makes it more relevant to the business and it by the way as a data engineer also you become important to the business you're not just some guy buried in the balls organization playing with technology you're now a key aspect of the company's ability to drive,</span><br>
<span title="50:39 - 50:42">revenue and to monetize what they've got his assets.</span><br>
<span title="50:43 - 50:50">So make the shift and I think you will find the conversations you get involved in will change dramatically and they'll be a lot more fun.</span><br>
